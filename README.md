## Deadlines

## General specifications
[Jules White repo](https://github.com/juleswhite/CSX278/tree/master/Assignments/Asgn1)

## React-specific requirements

1. Your assignment must build on the JHipster team's assignment solution and create a React UI for
   CRUD operations on one of the entities so that your classmates know how to build a UI for an existing HTTP API.
2. Your assignment must include creating tests for the UI so that your classmates know how to test
   their front-end code. 
3. You must create a set of instructions on how to install and setup any locally installed software that your classmates must complete
   before your assignment is released in class so that the in-class component of the assignment is not dedicated
   primarily to installing a bunch of stuff.
4. You must track who completed the software setup prior to class and provide this list to the TA so that
   we can use it for grading purposes.
5. You must post your installation and setup instructions in the class' Git repo along with your outside
   learning materials.
